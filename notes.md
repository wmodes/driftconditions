# Basic node/express/react/axios notes

At this point we have a working Express server and React client. We also use Axios to communicate between the two.

## Start Up

To start the server (assuming we are at the root of our project):

```
cd server
node index.js
```

To start the react client (first going back to the root of the project):

```
cd client
npm run start
```

Starting the mysql server:

```
/usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir\=/usr/local/var/mysql
```
