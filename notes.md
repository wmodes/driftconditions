# Basic Node/React/MySQL App Notes

At this point we have a working Express server and React client talking to a MySQL database.

## Start Up

To start the server (assuming we are at the root of our project):

```
cd server
node index.js
```

To start the react client (first going back to the root of the project):

```
cd client
npm run start
```

Starting the mysql server:

```
/usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir\=/usr/local/var/mysql
```

static on a radio driving on a dark highway. 
sounds in a seashell . 
shattered dreams. 
diaspora from a catalyzing event. 
a faded bar in a forgotten part of town. 
a broken jukebox in which you can still hear echos. 
a speech that no one was there to hear. 
rain on a metal roof.
