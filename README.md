# Interference

Interference is a online streaming audio source that captures the chaos and serendipity of late-night radio tuning in an uncanny audio stream generated on the fly by code. Overlapping fragmented stories, ambient sounds, and mysterious crosstalk weave a vivid sonic tapestry that draws listeners into an immersive and unpredictable listening experience. Inspired by the unpredictability of real-world radio interference, Interference explores the boundaries between intention and happenstance, inviting listeners to eavesdrop on a hidden world of voices and atmospheres unconstrained by traditional narrative structures. With each new listening session, Interference offers a fresh journey through its evocative auditory landscape.

## Presentation

Visitors to Interference can tune in to an ongoing audio feed. 

## Behind the Scenes

Behind the scenes, Interference allows users to contribute and edit audio and compositional recipes. These recipes use audio sources to construct the audio feed on the fly.

## Technologies

Here is a list of technologies we are relying on:

**Frontend:**

- React.js: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Redux Toolkit: State management library used for managing the application state globally.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for designing custom user interfaces.

**Backend:**

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side of the application.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- MySQL: Relational database management system used for storing and retrieving user and audio data.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For implementing token-based authentication.
- bcrypt: For hashing and securing user passwords.
- multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for uploading files.

**Other Technologies:**

- get-audio-duration: A package used to determine the duration of audio files.
- dotenv: For managing environment variables.

## Other Possibilities

Other names I considered, giving you a flavor of the project, like a Tom Waits side hustle:

- Crosstalk
- Overlap
- Murmurations
- Mindwave
- Whisperstream
- The Undercurrent
- The Overheard
- The Underswell
- The Moonlit Streambed
- The Unseen Choirs
- The Night's Orphans

In the end, I figured fuck it: The project name is chosen on the fly.
